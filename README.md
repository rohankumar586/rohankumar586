#*👋Hello! Welcome to my GitHub*

My name is Rohan. I'm a number geek who likes storytelling using data. I'm dedicated to bridging the gap between data science and strategic decision-making.

I'm studying [Master of Management Analytics at McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/programs/mma). My journey has equipped me with advanced skills in statistical analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence that I have been able to apply to real word datasets, with results in my GitHub. I have previously applied these skills in sales and marketing team at multinational company, driving sales growth and cheaper raw material procurement. 

I am excited to meet new people and expand my knowledge in various subjects. You can connect with me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohan-kumar586/) or email me at rohan.kumar@mail.mcgill.ca

Technologies I have been working with:
- PowerBI
- SQL
- Python
- RStudio
- Microsoft Office
- SAP
