# *👋Hello! Welcome to my GitHub*

I'm Rohan. Numbers fascinate me, and I love telling stories that they hide. I'm all about connecting the dots between data science and making smart business decisions.

Right now, I'm deep into my [Master of Management Analytics](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/programs/mma) program at McGill University. It's been an amazing ride, sharpening my skills in everything from statistical analysis to machine learning. And guess what? I've been putting these skills to the test on real-world data, with some cool projects you can check out on my GitHub.

Before diving into my masters, I helped the sales and marketing team at Midas Safety. Over there, I got to play with numbers in a way that actually boosted our sales and helped us cut down on costs for raw materials. Pretty neat, right?

Technologies I have been working with:
- PowerBI
- SQL
- Python
- RStudio
- Microsoft Office
- SAP

I'm studying . My journey has equipped me with advanced skills in statistical analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence that I have been able to apply to real word datasets, with results in my GitHub. Previously, I have leveraged these skills in a sales and marketing role at a multinational company. There, I played a pivotal role in driving sales growth and reducing costs in raw material procurement through data-driven strategies.
